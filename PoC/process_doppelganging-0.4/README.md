Characteristics:
-

+ Payload mapped as `MEM_IMAGE` (unnamed: not linked to any file)
+ Sections mapped with original access rights (no `RWX`)
+ Payload connected to PEB as the main module
+ Remote injection supported (but only into a newly created process)
+ Process is created from an unnamed module (`GetProcessImageFileName` returns empty string)
